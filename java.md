###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A function is a piece of code that serves a specific function (wow). We can call it by its name, with or without arguments passed in as parameters, and it can return something (e.g. a variable) as a result, or perform some action if declared void.  A method is a function that is associated with a certain object, so as Java is an OO language, all of its functions are methods.

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
